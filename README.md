## Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

The hotel primarily operates in four cities: Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad. There are two types of rooms among which the customers can choose one, namely, Elite, Premium, Presidential and Standard. There are two categories of hotels: i) Business ii) Luxury.


### Steps followed 
A high-level overview of the steps in the project are:
- Data Loading : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file. The data is present in the form of dimension and fact tables in multiple csv files. All these files have been loaded into Power BI
- Data Transformation : Open power query and make necessary transformations to the data, like handling duplicates, anomalies and any other minor changes. Combining few tables into a fact table has also been done in this step. After the transformation, closing and loading the data has been done.
- Data Modelling : Relationships between the dimension and fact tables have been established in order to make further analysis meaningful. Without proper data modelling, there is a high risk of incorrect analysis which leads to visualizations showing inaccurate results.
- Data Visualization : In this step, the data has been visualized which gives deep insights into the operations of the company. The overall dashboard tells a meaningful story about the business and drives the strategic decision-making of the executives.

- Certain measures have been created using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions). 


- At the top of the dashboard, we can find various filters which when selected, the information on the dashboard changes accordingly. The filters are: i) city ii) room type
- Based on the selection of the month either May or June or July the information is displayed. The information is available from Week 19 to Week 30 which again changes according to the specific week selected.
- There are KPIs like Revenue, RevPar*, DSRN*, Occupancy%, ADR*,Realisation%. All of these KPIs are shown in comparison with week-over-week change of the particular KPI.
- We can also see how the type of the day (weekday or weekend) is affecting these KPIs in the form of a table.
- These KPIs are seen as a trend line from May to July in the form of a line chart.
- With no filters selected, we can see the Average rating given to hotels which is 3.62.
- Occupancy% of hotels by category can be seen in the form of a donut chart. It looks like business hotels and luxury hotels almost have the same occupancy. 
- In another donut chart, with no filters selected we can see the revenue generated by different cities and Mumbai seems like the city which generates the highest revenue.
- There is also a bar chart which shows the occupancy% of hotels in different cities and in this chart we can see that Delhi's hotels overall have the highest occupancy.
- The table at the bottom of the dashboard shows a table which contains different hotels and crucial metrics like Revenue, RevPar, Occupancy%, Average rating, Cancelled%, ADR, DBRN, DSRN, DURN, Realisation%.
- There are various booking platforms  through which bookings are genrally done by customers. The line and bar chart shows realisation% and ADR generated from different booking platforms. 

Terminology:
- RevPar: RevPAR represents the revenue generated per available room, whether or not they are occupied. RevPAR helps hotels measure their revenue generating performance to accurately price rooms. RevPAR can help hotels measure themselves against other properties or brands.
The formula used to generate the measure RevPAR is:

RevPAR = DIVIDE([Revenue],[Total Capacity])

- Occupancy%: Occupancy means total successful bookings happened to the total rooms available(capacity). The formula for occupancy% is:
Occupancy % = DIVIDE([Total Succesful Bookings],[Total Capacity],0)

- Cancelled%: To get the % of "Cancelled" bookings out of all Total bookings happened.
Cancellation % = DIVIDE([Total cancelled bookings],[Total Bookings])

- ADR (Average  Daily Rate): It is the ratio of revenue to the total rooms booked/sold. It is the measure of the average paid for rooms sold in a given time period

ADR = DIVIDE( [Revenue], [Total Bookings],0)

- DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights): This metrics tells on average how many rooms are booked for a day considering a time period.

DBRN = DIVIDE([Total Bookings], [No of days])

- DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights): This metrics tells on average how many rooms are ready to sell for a day considering a time period.

DSRN = DIVIDE([Total Capacity], [No of days])

- DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights): This metric tells on average how many rooms are succesfully utilized by customers for a day considering a time period.

DURN = DIVIDE([Total Checked Out],[No of days])

- Revenue WoW change%: To get the revenue change percentage week over week.Here, revcw  for current week, revpw for previous week.

Revenue WoW change % = 
Var selv = IF(HASONEFILTER(dim_date[wn]),SELECTEDVALUE(dim_date[wn]),MAX(dim_date[wn]))
var revcw = CALCULATE([Revenue],dim_date[wn]= selv)
var revpw =  CALCULATE([Revenue],FILTER(ALL(dim_date),dim_date[wn]= selv-1))

return


DIVIDE(revcw,revpw,0)-1

- Occupancy% WoW change: To get the occupancy change percentage week over week.Here, revcw  for current week
, revpw for previous week

Occupancy WoW change % = 
Var selv = IF(HASONEFILTER(dim_date[wn]),SELECTEDVALUE(dim_date[wn]),MAX(dim_date[wn]))
var revcw = CALCULATE([Occupancy %],dim_date[wn]= selv)
var revpw =  CALCULATE([Occupancy %],FILTER(ALL(dim_date),dim_date[wn]= selv-1))

return


DIVIDE(revcw,revpw,0)-1

- ADR WoW change %: To get the ADR(Average Daily rate) change percentage week over week.Here, revcw  for current week, revpw for previous week.

ADR WoW change % = 
Var selv = IF(HASONEFILTER(dim_date[wn]),SELECTEDVALUE(dim_date[wn]),MAX(dim_date[wn]))
var revcw = CALCULATE([ADR],dim_date[wn]= selv)
var revpw =  CALCULATE([ADR],FILTER(ALL(dim_date),dim_date[wn]= selv-1))

return


DIVIDE(revcw,revpw,0)-1

- Revpar WoW change %: To get the RevPar(Revenue Per Available Room) change percentage week over week. Here, revcw  for current week, revpw for previous week.

Revpar WoW change % = 
Var selv = IF(HASONEFILTER(dim_date[wn]),SELECTEDVALUE(dim_date[wn]),MAX(dim_date[wn]))
var revcw = CALCULATE([RevPAR],dim_date[wn]= selv)
var revpw =  CALCULATE([RevPAR],FILTER(ALL(dim_date),dim_date[wn]= selv-1))

return


DIVIDE(revcw,revpw,0)-1

- DSRN WoW change %: To get the DSRN(Daily Sellable Room Nights) change percentage week over week. Here, revcw  for current week, revpw for previous week.

DSRN WoW change % = 
Var selv = IF(HASONEFILTER(dim_date[wn]),SELECTEDVALUE(dim_date[wn]),MAX(dim_date[wn]))
var revcw = CALCULATE([DSRN],dim_date[wn]= selv)
var revpw =  CALCULATE([DSRN],FILTER(ALL(dim_date),dim_date[wn]= selv-1))

return


DIVIDE(revcw,revpw,0)-1
